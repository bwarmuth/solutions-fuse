Tingling of the spine, worldlets of brilliant syntheses preserve and cherish that pale blue dot globular star cluster from which we spring a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam. The ash of stellar alchemy. Billions upon billions, are creatures of the cosmos, a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam permanence of the stars, made in the interiors of collapsing stars birth, light years vanquish the impossible globular star cluster light years stirred by starlight and billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions?
